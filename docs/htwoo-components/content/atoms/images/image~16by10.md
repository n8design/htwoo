# 16:10 Aspect Ratio Image

Slightly taller widescreen format used for specific card layouts.

## Overview

The 16:10 aspect ratio image provides a more vertical space compared to 16:9 while still maintaining a widescreen appearance. This aspect ratio is especially useful for content that benefits from the additional vertical space.

## Usage

The 16:10 image aspect ratio is primarily used in:
* Teams splash card headers
* Dashboard panels
* Presentation slides
* Specific UI components requiring a slightly taller widescreen format

## Accessibility

* Provide descriptive `alt` text that explains the content and context of the image
* When used as background or hero images, ensure text overlaid has sufficient contrast
