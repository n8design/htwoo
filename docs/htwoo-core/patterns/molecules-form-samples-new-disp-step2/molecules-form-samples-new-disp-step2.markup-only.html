        Upon investigation, the issue is likely related to a failure in the heating element or a malfunction in the
        machineâ€™s brewing cycle, both common problems for this type of coffee machine. To resolve the issue, a
        technician will need to inspect the internal components, particularly the heating element, water pump, and
        circuit board responsible for activating the brewing process.
        <br><br>
        In cases where this fault has occurred
        previously, a reset procedure or replacement of the faulty components has successfully restored normal
        operation. If the issue is more severe, a full machine replacement may be necessary. Regular maintenance and
        occasional cleaning of the internal mechanisms are recommended to prevent similar occurrences in the future.
