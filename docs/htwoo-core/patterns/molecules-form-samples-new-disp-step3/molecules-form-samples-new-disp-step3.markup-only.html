        When the coffee machine refused to cooperate, the team implemented an interim solution by transitioning to
        tea-making using the office kettle. This alternative required no technical intervention, leveraging existing
        resources and allowing employees to maintain their caffeine intake with tea bags and hot water. While
        unconventional for coffee enthusiasts, this workaround provided a temporary fix, sustaining morale until the
        coffee machine could be repaired or replaced.

        Feedback from the team suggests a newfound appreciation for Earl Grey, though calls for espresso have
        increased in urgency.
