# Using the GenericThemes Class

The GenericThemes class provides handling for setting up the CSS Variables that the htwoo-* library depends on to render the controls with the appropriate styling for the theme of the surface they are being rendered. 

## Initialize

The class can be instatiated by creating a new instance in the root ts file of your project and then initializing it in your "start" method. This sample imports a sample theme from the `@n8d/htwoo-core` library but you can also create your own by implementing the `IHOOTheme` interface.

```typescript
import { GenericThemes, IGenericThemes } from '@n8d/htwoo-react/GenericThemes';
import { IHOOTheme } from '@n8d/htwoo-react/IHOOTheme';
// Note there are multiple theme files defined in the HTWOO-Core project
import blueTheme from '@n8d/htwoo-core/lib/sass/themes/blue.theme.json';

private _genericThemes: IGenericThemes = new GenericThemes();
private _rootDomElement: HTMLElement;

private _start(): void {
  // Get _rootDomElement, or it's defined elsewhere
  this._genericThemes.initThemeHandler(this._rootDomElement, blueTheme);
}
```

NOTE:
To import the theme as a json file you will need to enable typescript to import json files by adding the following to your tsconfig.json file in the compilerOptions section:

```json
"compilerOptions": {
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
}
```

## Available Constants

In addition, the SPFxThemes class exports two constants that can be utilized based on your needs.

### genericThemes

The first is an exported constant `genericThemes` that can be utilized anywhere in your solution by simply importing the constant into your file and making sure you've initialized it in the start method of your project. 

### GenericThemesContext - React Context ThemeProvider

The second is an exported React Context Provider called `GenericThemesContext` which can be used to add a Context provider to your React application. 

```typescript
import { GenericThemes, IGenericThemes, GenericThemesContext } from '@n8d/htwoo-react/GenericThemes';
// Note there are multiple theme files defined in the HTWOO-Core project
import blueTheme from '@n8d/htwoo-core/lib/sass/themes/blue.theme.json';

private _genericThemes: IGenericThemes = new GenericThemes();
private _rootDomElement: HTMLElement;

private _start(): void {
  // Get _rootDomElement, or it's defined elsewhere
  this._genericThemes.initThemeHandler(this._rootDomElement, blueTheme);
}

public render(): void {
  let element = null;
  try {
    const props: IMyComponentProps = { };
    element = React.createElement(
      MyComponent, props
    );
      
    //Pass in the private _spfxThemes variable as the value to the provider
    const provider = React.createElement(GenericThemesContext.Provider, { value: this._genericThemes }, element);
    ReactDom.render(provider, this.domElement);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`${this.LOG_SOURCE} (render) ${err}`);
  }
}
```

To consume the provider in a React Component you would do the following

```typescript
import { GenericThemesContext, GenericThemes } from '@n8d/htwoo-react/GenericThemes';

export default class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent<IMyComponentProps, IMyComponentState> {
  static contextType = GenericThemesContext;
  private _genericThemes: GenericThemes;

  constructor(props: IMyComponentProps) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {};
  }

  //After the component mounts the instance of the initialized _spfxThemes class is available to the component.
  public componentDidMount(): void {
    this._genericThemes = this.context;
  }

  ....

}
```

## Properties

  ### domElement: HTMLElement

  Provides a getter/setter for the domElement the theme is applied to.

  ### currentTheme: any (ReadOnly)

  Provides a method to retrieve the currewnt JSON theme applied to the domElement. Overridden when calling `setCSSVariables` or `initThemeHandler`.

## Methods

### initThemeHandler: (domElement: HTMLElement, defaultTheme?: IHOOTheme) => void;

 Property | Type | Optional (Default) | Description
  ---|---|---|---
  domElement | HTMLElement | | The element to inject the CSS Variables onto, this scopes those variables to any siblings or children of that root element.
  defaultTheme | IHOOTheme | Optional | The default theme to apply to the DOM element.
