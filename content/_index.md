  <h2>Why hTWOo</h2>
  <p>We strongly believe that accessibility, inclusivity, and performance are essential for every front-end framework. hTWOo was built with this in mind. It allows you to develop customisations and applications for Microsoft 365 and web applications and provides the fastest way to implement Fluent Design.</p>
  <p>Built on a strong fundament of semantic markup, it brings longevity to your applications while gradually involving over time, which makes the upgrade path as smooth as possible.</p>
  <p>hTWOo was built on the <a href="https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/" target="_blank">Atomic Design Methodology</a>, making it easy for the developer to use and reuse built-in components to create new experiences faster without reinventing the wheel.</p>
  <p>
  hTWOo is the only <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/" target="_blank">Fluent Design System</a> implementation offering HTML and CSS components in its core. Which is also the fundment
  In addition, hTWOo also provides a dedicated ReactJS version.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><strong>Don’t get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water.</strong> Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash.</p>
  <p>Be water, my friend. - (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMwBwFj5nQ">Bruce Lee</a>)</p>
