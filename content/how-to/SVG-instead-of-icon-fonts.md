Fonts are for text, not for images or icons. Whenever an image is needed, use an image. In this regards, hTWOo is 100% icon font free.

[Seren Davies: Death to icon fonts ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xXBYcWgCHA) talk explains many reasons why icon fonts are not good to be used on the web.

Another reason is to avoid copyright issues with Microsoft Fluent UI system icons. You will find a complete set of Fluent System Icon in SVG in the repo [microsoft/fluentui-system-icons](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-system-icons)
