> **Don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water.** Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend. - [Bruce Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMwBwFj5nQ))

## Why just HTML and CSS

In the end it always comes down to HTML/CSS no matter which framework you use for your development. HTML/CSS documented components serve no other longevity than any other framework. HTML and CSS can also be easily translate, included and embedded in any other development framework.

HTML/CSS UI components can also be easier optimized, refactored or visually enhanced.

## Concepts

hTWOo style guide, documentation and building platform is based on [patternlab.io](https://patternlab.io/). To allow the most flexible implementation of designs and design pattern it follows the [Atomic Design Methodology](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) coined by Brad Frost around 2012 / 2013.

> We're tasked with making interfaces for more users in more contexts using more browsers on more devices with more screen sizes and more capabilities than ever before. That's a daunting task indeed. Thankfully, design systems are here to help. - [Brad Frost](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)
