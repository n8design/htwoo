Liquid UI is an open source alternative for Microsoft's Fluent UI Web Design system. Despite being ReactJS exclusive this project offers a style guide based on HTML and CSS to create implementations for other frameworks as well.

The first implementation of Liquid UI Framework will be based on ReactJS, with options to support a wider range of frameworks in the future.

It plays nicely together with applications such as Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft Teams.

> **Don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water.** Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend. - [Bruce Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMwBwFj5nQ))
