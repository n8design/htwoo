# HTWOO UI framework

HTWOO UI is an open source alternative for Microsoft's Fluent UI Web Design system. [hTWOo Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8d/htwoo-core) is a pure HTML/CSS and JavaScript implementation that can be used in any project. In addition, [hTWOo React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n8d/htwoo-react) is a component based implementation that can be used in any ReactJS project (>= React 16).

> **Don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it grow, be like water.** Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend. - [Bruce Lee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMwBwFj5nQ))

### Why just HTML and CSS

In the end it always comes down to HTML/CSS, no matter which framework you use for your development. HTML/CSS documented components serve no other longevity than any other framework. HTML and CSS can also be easily translated, included, and embedded in any other development framework.

HTML/CSS UI components can also be more easily optimized, refactored, or visually enhanced.

## HTWOO-React

For ReactJS developers, we have an implementation of the htwoo-core library where we have provided a set of components compatible with Versions >=16 of [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

A complete getting stared guide plus full documentation on all the ReactJS components available can be found on our [StoryBook Documentation](https://lab.n8d.studio/htwoo/htwoo-react/)

## Concepts

The hTWOo style guide, documentation and building platform is based on [patternlab.io](https://patternlab.io/). To allow the most flexible implementation of designs and design patterns, it follows the [Atomic Design Methodology](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) coined by Brad Frost around 2012 / 2013.

> We're tasked with making interfaces for more users in more contexts using more browsers on more devices with more screen sizes and more capabilities than ever before. That's a daunting task indeed. Thankfully, design systems are here to help. - [Brad Frost](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)
