## Theming support for shimmer

Shimmer also supports theming based on the SharePoint theme. This can be accomplished in two ways.
The following three themes are supported.

* No theme or `hoo-ph-neutral` - use for the neutral based background color gradient.
* `hoo-ph-primary` - use for the primary theme base background colors;
* `hoo-ph-fancy` - use for the fancy gradients based background color gradient.

This style sheet classes can be added to a complete block as well es directly on the placeholder container.
