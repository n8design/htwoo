title: Success Label
---

## Overview
Success messages provide positive feedback to users when their input passes validation or when a form has been successfully submitted. This component uses a distinct success color to indicate that no further action is needed.

## Usage
Success messages should be appropriately associated with their corresponding form elements or contexts. The `errorRelationID` can be used to link the message to a specific form element.

Example:
```html
<div>
  <label for="email">Email</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" aria-describedby="email-success" class="hoo-input">
  <span class="hoo-success" id="email-success">Email is valid</span>
</div>
```

## CSS Classes

- `.hoo-success`: The main class for success message styling

## SCSS Variables and Properties

- Color: Uses the `$successText` color variable
- Font size: 12px (converted to rem)

### SCSS Imports

## Accessibility

- Success messages should be associated with form controls using `aria-describedby` where appropriate
- Messages should be clear, concise, and provide confirmation of success
