Validation components in HTWOO provide visual feedback regarding the status of user input in forms. They come in different states to indicate success or errors in form submission or data entry.

## Available Validation Components

- **Error Message**: Displays an error message for form validation failures
- **Success Message**: Shows success status for successful form validation

## Usage

Validation components are typically used in conjunction with form inputs to provide feedback to users about the validity of their input. They should be properly associated with their corresponding form elements using ARIA attributes for accessibility.
