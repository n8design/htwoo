# File Input

HTWOO UI provides a file input component for uploading files in forms.

## Overview

The file input component allows users to select and upload files from their device. It supports both single and multiple file selection and can be configured to accept specific file types.

## Basic File Input

Standard file input for selecting a single file.

```html
<div class="hoo-file-upload">
  <label for="file-input">Choose a file</label>
  <input type="file" id="file-input" name="file-input">
</div>
```

## Multiple File Input

File input configured to accept multiple files.

```html
<div class="hoo-file-upload">
  <label for="multi-file-input">Choose files</label>
  <input type="file" id="multi-file-input" name="multi-file-input" multiple>
</div>
```

## File Type Restriction

File input limited to specific file types.

```html
<div class="hoo-file-upload">
  <label for="image-file-input">Select an image</label>
  <input type="file" id="image-file-input" name="image-file-input" accept="image/*">
