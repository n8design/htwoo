## Overview
Paragraph elements (`<p>`) are used for blocks of text in the HTWOO design system. They are styled consistently for readability and proper spacing between blocks of content.

## Usage
Use paragraph elements for blocks of textual content. Multiple paragraphs create visual separation between ideas or concepts.

Example:
```html
<p>This is the first paragraph of content that provides an introduction.</p>
<p>This second paragraph continues the content with additional details and information.</p>
```

## Accessibility

- Paragraphs should use proper semantic structure
- Text should have sufficient contrast with its background
- Line length should be limited to improve readability
- Spacing between paragraphs helps to create visual separation and improves readability
