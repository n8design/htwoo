# Video Thumbnail

The Video Thumbnail component displays an image representation of video content with optional caption.

## Overview

Video thumbnails provide a static preview of video content, allowing users to see what a video contains before playing it. They are typically used in video galleries, lists, or anywhere video content is presented in a browsable format.

## Features

- Semantic HTML structure using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
- Responsive image sizing with overflow handling
- Optional caption support for video description
- Compatible with Video Overlay component
- Consistent styling with other media components
- Properly labeled images for accessibility
- Border radius for modern appearance

## Usage

Video thumbnails are commonly used:

- As clickable previews to launch video players
- In video galleries or collections
- On content cards featuring video
- In search results for video content
- As preview images in media-rich content

### With Video Overlay

Thumbnails are often paired with the Video Overlay component to indicate playability:

```html
<div class="hoo-thumbnail">
  <figure class="hoo-thumbnail-figure">
    <img src="path/to/thumbnail.jpg" alt="Video description" class="hoo-thumbnail-img">
    <figcaption class="hoo-thumbnail-cap">Video description</figcaption>
    <div class="hoo-thumbnail-overlay">
      <span class="hoo-icon-svg"><!-- Play icon SVG --></span>
      <div class="hoo-video-duration">1:42</div>
    </div>
  </figure>
</div>
```
