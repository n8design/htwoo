Columns allow you to define a checkbox group across multiple columns. You are able to define different colum counts for mobile and desktop by using the following CSS variables.

- --cols-desk
- --cols-mobile

In this example the following CSS variables are defined:

```html
<div class="hoo-checkbox-group" style="--cols-desk: 2; --cols-mobile: 1">
```

This example uses a two columns setup for desktop and mobile just one column.
